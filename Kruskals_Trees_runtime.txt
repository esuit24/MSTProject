Run time analysis of Kruskal's with trees:

makeSets = O(n)
- Sets each vertex's parent in input as itself, which takes linear time with
respect to the number of vertices

quickSort = O(nlogn)

Iteration through edges = O(m)
    First find = O(n)
    Second find = O(n)
        - Find parent of i by going up the tree, time to find parent is
        proportional to the height of the tree so this can take linear time
        with respect to the number of vertices

    Union = O(1)
        - Set parent of one vertex as the parent of the other, assignment can
        be made in constant time
    tree.append = O(1)
        - Appending to list can be done in constant time

Iteration through tree = O(m)
- Summing all edges in tree can be done in linear time with respect to the
 number of edges by iterating through the edges in the tree


Run time for makesets and quicksort = O(nlogn)
Run time for finds = O(mn)
Run time for Final iteration = O(m)

Therefore the total run time = O(nlogn + mn)
